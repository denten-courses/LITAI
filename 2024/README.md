### Course Description

In this course we will consider the long history of literature composed with, for, and by
machines. Our reading list will start with Ramon Llull, the thirteenth-century combinatorial
mystic, and continue with readings from Gottfried Leibniz, Francis Bacon, Jonathan Swift, and
Samuel Butler. We will read "Plot Robots" instrumental to the writing of Hollywood scripts and
pulp fiction of the 1920s, the avant-garde poetry of Dada and OULIPO, computer-generated love
letters written by Alan Turing, and novels created by the first generation of artificial
intelligence researchers in the 1950s and 60s. The course will conclude at the present moment,
with an exploration of machine learning techniques of the sort used by Siri, Alexa, and other
contemporary chat bots.

No prior experience with computer science or in the humanities is required. The course should
appeal to technologists seeking to gain a deeper, cultural understanding of their craft in
historical context; and to those students in the humanities or the social sciences interested
in exploring the technical manifestations of generative poetics and creativity.

Contact information is posted on our [Courseworks page](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/143944).
All readings linked from this page. Please print and bring to class when possible.

### Course Requirements & Grading

Weekly lectures will be followed by occasional hands-on lab sessions (usually involving pen and paper). 
Students will be expected to keep up with a moderate reading load, to attend weekly lectures, and to participate in the class
discussion, both in person and online. Advanced students will have the option to integrate the
course's themes with the subject matter of their expertise.

- 25%     Class & Online Participation
- 25%     Midterm Project
- 25%     Final Exam (May 8, 1:10-4 PM, Uris 326)
- 25%     Final Project

All written assignments should be submitted to our Courseworks page.

Discussion Forum posts are due on Tuesdays, by midnight. You are encouraged to respond to
others as well as to write new posts. In either case, stay close to the text by discussing
specific passages. A good response will elicit conversation, ask questions, express
puzzlement or illuminate particularly lucid moments of the work.

### Class and University Policies

**The usage of electronic devices is strongly discouraged in the classroom.**

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors,
and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately,
not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> 
or ask me for help early in the writing process.
